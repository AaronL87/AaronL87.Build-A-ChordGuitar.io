# Build-A-Chord Guitar App
This app is hosted by Github Pages [here](https://aaronl87.github.io/AaronL87.Build-A-CordGuitar.io/).

This is based on a project I made in Excel in 2018, seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfWmnnegRTWOyKYqtyJ4zkp7vByrmPMrsCeubvCgsXs/edit?usp=sharing).

The app makes the Excel information easier to understand and use.
