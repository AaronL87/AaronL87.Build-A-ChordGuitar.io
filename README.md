# Build-A-Chord Guitar App
This app is hosted by Github Pages [here](https://aaronliftig.github.io/AaronL87.Build-A-ChordGuitar.io/).

This is based on a project I made in Excel in 2018, seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfWmnnegRTWOyKYqtyJ4zkp7vByrmPMrsCeubvCgsXs/edit?usp=sharing).

The app makes the Excel information easier to understand and use. Currently, the app uses modulo 12 (number of notes in the octave) to produce the chord names and colors, so 9, 11, and 13-chords are represented with the wrong names but have colors that are still useful.
