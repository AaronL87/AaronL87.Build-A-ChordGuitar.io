Logic for an Original Guitar App

This is based on a project I made in Excel in 2018, seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfWmnnegRTWOyKYqtyJ4zkp7vByrmPMrsCeubvCgsXs/edit?usp=sharing

It will make the Excel information easier to understand and use. 

Has logic for both Python and Javascript because it was prototyped in Python. Will be made into a client-side app using html/css/javascript.
